# Training_Pad_Vibration_and_OTA_Firmware

This repository contains part of the project "TrainingPAD" developed by Intelligent Wireless Network Group (IWING), Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University.
Due to the policy, publishing the full details of the project, including firmware, is prohibited. Only a part of it can be published.

## Overview of the project "TrainingPAD"
The training pad system was designed to assess athletes' agility and reaction time. It can accurately measure key performance metrics such as reaction speed and movement of the athletes with various sensors and peripherals integrated into a printed circuit board we designed. 

The training pad operated with ESP32 will collect real-time information from sensors and peripherals and send the data via Bluetooth to our mobile application in the user's phone, which is designed to set the test pattern, calculate the information from the training pad, and present the data to coaches.

This system provides information to the coaches about athletes' performance, which coaches can use the information to design proper training to improve athletes' performance.

## Contents
This repository contains a part of the firmware I participate in. The firmware is developed using ESP-IDF framework.
