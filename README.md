# Training_Pad_Vibration_and_OTA_Firmware

This repository contains part of the project "TrainingPAD" developed by Intelligent Wireless Network Group (IWING), Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University.
Due to the policy, publishing full detail of the project, including firmware, is prohibited. Only allow to publish a part of of it.

## Overview of the project "TrainingPAD"
The training pad system designed to assess athletes' agility and reaction time. The system can accurately measure key performance metrics such as reaction speed and movement of the athletes with various sensors and peripherals integrated in printed circuit board we designed. 

The training pad operated with ESP32 will collect the real-time information from sensors and peripherals and send the data via Bluetooth to our mobile application in user's phone, which designed to set the test pattern, calculate the information from training pad, and present the data to coaches.

This system provides the information to the coaches about athletes' performance, which coaches can use the information to design proper training to improve athletes' performance.

## Contents
In this repository contains a part of firmware I participate with. The firmware is developed using ESP-IDF framework.
